Table: InvoiceLine

Description: 
The InvoiceLine table stores information about individual lines on an invoice, including the invoice ID, track ID, unit price, quantity, and a unique invoice line ID. The table has foreign keys referencing the Invoice and Track tables to establish relationships between them.

Use Case: 
This table is primarily used to manage and track the details of individual invoice lines, including the items being invoiced, their quantities, and prices, in order to generate accurate invoices and track inventory levels.

Schema: 
CREATE TABLE [InvoiceLine]
(
    [InvoiceLineId] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
    [InvoiceId] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
    [TrackId] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
    [UnitPrice] NUMERIC(10,2)  NOT NULL,
    [Quantity] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_InvoiceLine] PRIMARY KEY  ([InvoiceLineId]),
    FOREIGN KEY ([InvoiceId]) REFERENCES [Invoice] ([InvoiceId]) 
		ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION,
    FOREIGN KEY ([TrackId]) REFERENCES [Track] ([TrackId]) 
		ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION
)

{'InvoiceLineId': 1, 'InvoiceId': 1, 'TrackId': 2, 'UnitPrice': 0.99, 'Quantity': 1}
{'InvoiceLineId': 2, 'InvoiceId': 1, 'TrackId': 4, 'UnitPrice': 0.99, 'Quantity': 1}
{'InvoiceLineId': 3, 'InvoiceId': 2, 'TrackId': 6, 'UnitPrice': 0.99, 'Quantity': 1}
{'InvoiceLineId': 4, 'InvoiceId': 2, 'TrackId': 8, 'UnitPrice': 0.99, 'Quantity': 1}
{'InvoiceLineId': 5, 'InvoiceId': 2, 'TrackId': 10, 'UnitPrice': 0.99, 'Quantity': 1}
